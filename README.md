We wanted to choose colors that reflected the environment so we chose a variety of green, blues and browns.  

Image of colors here.  

### Typography ###

The chosen fonts were imported from Google Fonts for use in the website.  

We have chosen to use the oxygen-font which is a sans serif-font which is great for accessibility and dyslexic users.
